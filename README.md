IdrisTddScalaNotes
==================

This project accompanies my [IdrisTddNotes](https://github.com/rpeszek/IdrisTddNotes/wiki) 
that follow 'Type Driven Development with Idris'
book and compare Idris to Haskell.

When this work gets into a more advanced state, I will think about incorporating these Scala programs  
[IdrisTddNotes wiki pages](https://github.com/rpeszek/IdrisTddNotes/wiki). 

Very much __work-in-progress__
